# Ceaser Cipher Algorithm

In Ceaser Cipher Algorithm, Substitution technique is used for conversion from plain text to cipher text.
It involves in replacing each letter by K values.

Basic idea of Ceaser Cipher technique is:

1. Encryption 

Cipher-text = (plain + Key)mod(26)

2. Decryption

Plain-text = (Cipher - Key)mod(26)
